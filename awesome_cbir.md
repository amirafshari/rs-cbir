Here are some interesting repo and projects which are related to one of 1) image retrieval, 2) image captioning, or 3) remote sensing and large LLMs. The structure of the awesome is not shaped well yet. But, by adding more interesting content, we would be able to categorize items better.

Some applications of satellite image retrieval techniques are barrowed from [arampacha](https://github.com/arampacha/CLIP-rsicd?tab=readme-ov-file#applications):
* National Defense and anti-terrorism initiatives -- analysis of satellite imagery or drone footage to quickly find specific features and address them before they become bigger problems.
* Climate Change initiatives -- ability to spot and address wildfires and refugee migration patterns before they become unmanageable; ability to spot things that might otherwise go unnoticed, such as island-size plastic garbage floating in oceans; ability to systematically track deforestation and desertification over time; etc.
* Consumer Applications -- can help provide new functionality such as "make your own vacation" feature for map providers (Google Maps, Apple Maps). User selects how far they are willing to travel and the features they are looking for at their destination, for example, beaches and hiking trails, or mountains and snow, etc., and the application returns a ranked list of destinations within the desired travel radius.
